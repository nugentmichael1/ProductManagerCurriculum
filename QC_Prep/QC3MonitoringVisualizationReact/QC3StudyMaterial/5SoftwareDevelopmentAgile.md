## **1️⃣ Agile Methodology**
### **🔹 What is Agile?**
Agile is an **iterative software development approach** focused on **continuous delivery, collaboration, and flexibility**. Instead of delivering a product all at once, Agile **breaks work into smaller increments** called **sprints** (typically 1-4 weeks).  

### **🔹 Agile Principles (Manifesto for Agile Software Development)**
1. **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery.
2. **Welcoming changes** even late in development.
3. **Frequent delivery** of working software.
4. **Collaboration** between developers and stakeholders.
5. **Motivated individuals** over rigid processes.
6. **Face-to-face communication** is preferred.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. **Sustainable development pace** is maintained.
9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence**.
10. **Simplicity**—maximize the amount of work not done.
11. **Self-organizing teams** produce better designs.
12. **Regular reflection and adjustment**.

## **2️⃣ Agile and Scrum Processes**
### **🔹 What is Scrum?**
Scrum is an **Agile framework** that organizes work into small iterations called **sprints** (1-4 weeks). It follows structured **roles, artifacts, and ceremonies**.

### **🔹 Key Scrum Roles**
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Product Owner** | Defines features, maintains backlog |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates the process, removes blockers |
| **Development Team** | Builds, tests, and delivers features |

### **🔹 Scrum Workflow**
1. **Product Owner** creates & prioritizes the **Product Backlog**.
2. **Sprint Planning** selects items for the **Sprint Backlog**.
3. Team develops **incremental software** in short sprints (1-4 weeks).
4. **Daily Stand-ups** track progress.
5. **Sprint Review** demonstrates the completed work.
6. **Sprint Retrospective** identifies improvements.

---

## **3️⃣ Waterfall Methodology**
### **🔹 What is Waterfall?**
Waterfall is a **linear software development approach**, where work progresses **sequentially** through distinct phases:

1. **Requirements Gathering**  
2. **Design**  
3. **Implementation (Coding)**  
4. **Testing**  
5. **Deployment**  
6. **Maintenance**  

### **🔹 Characteristics**
- **Rigid and structured**: No going back to previous phases.
- **Less flexibility**: Any changes require restarting phases.
- **Best for well-defined projects** with stable requirements.

---

## **4️⃣ Agile vs. Waterfall**
| Feature | Agile | Waterfall |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Flexibility** | High (Changes welcomed) | Low (Rigid plan) |
| **Development Style** | Iterative & incremental | Sequential & structured |
| **Testing** | Continuous | After development |
| **Customer Involvement** | High (Frequent feedback) | Low (Feedback after full delivery) |
| **Best For** | Rapidly changing projects | Fixed scope & well-defined requirements |

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Agile**: Startups, SaaS applications, UI-heavy products.  
- **Waterfall**: Healthcare, government projects, financial applications.

---

## **5️⃣ Introduction to SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**
### **🔹 What is SDLC?**
SDLC defines the structured process for **planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software**.

### **🔹 SDLC Phases**
1. **Requirement Analysis** – What problem are we solving?  
2. **Design** – System architecture, UI/UX, database design.  
3. **Development** – Writing and implementing code.  
4. **Testing** – Ensuring software is bug-free.  
5. **Deployment** – Releasing the product.  
6. **Maintenance** – Patching, updates, and improvements.

---

## **6️⃣ Story Pointing and Burndown Charts**
### **🔹 What is Story Pointing?**
Story points measure the **effort required** to complete a task. Instead of time (hours), they use **relative complexity** (Fibonacci series: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.).

- **Small tasks → 1-3 points**  
- **Medium tasks → 5-8 points**  
- **Large tasks → 13+ points**  

### **🔹 What is a Burndown Chart?**
- **Tracks sprint progress** by comparing **work completed vs. work remaining**.  
- Helps teams identify **scope creep** and adjust workloads.  
- **Ideal burndown chart**: A smooth decline in remaining work.  

---

## **7️⃣ Scrum Ceremonies**
### **🔹 Key Scrum Events**
| Ceremony | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Sprint Planning** | Define sprint goals & backlog items |
| **Daily Stand-up** | Short meeting (15 min) to discuss progress & blockers |
| **Sprint Review** | Demo completed features to stakeholders |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Identify what worked & what to improve |

---

## **8️⃣ JIRA Basics: Managing Tasks and Sprints**
JIRA is a **project management tool** used for tracking Agile workflows.

### **🔹 Key JIRA Features**
- **Boards**: Displays tasks in Kanban/Scrum format.
- **Issues**: Any task, bug, or feature request.
- **Sprints**: Fixed time-boxed periods for development.
- **Epics**: Large user stories broken into smaller tasks.
- **Backlog**: List of tasks not yet in a sprint.

### **🔹 Managing a Sprint in JIRA**
1. **Create a Sprint** in the backlog.
2. Drag issues from **backlog → active sprint**.
3. During the sprint, update the **status** (`To Do → In Progress → Done`).
4. Close sprint & review the **burndown chart**.

## **9️⃣ Labels and Tags in JIRA**
### **🔹 What are Labels and Tags?**
Labels and tags in JIRA **categorize and filter issues**.

### **🔹 Using Labels for Issue Tracking**
- Assign **keywords** to JIRA issues to **group related tasks**.
- Use labels for **searching and filtering** in JIRA queries.

**Example:**  
- **`bug`, `frontend`, `API`, `urgent`**  

JIRA Query for all frontend bugs:
```JQL
project = "MyApp" AND labels in ("frontend", "bug")
```

---

## **🔟 Examples of Common Labels Used in SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)**
| Label | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **bug** | A software defect |
| **incident** | System outage or degradation |
| **hotfix** | Urgent production fix |
| **enhancement** | A feature request or improvement |
| **performance** | Issues related to slow response times |
| **database** | Database-related tasks or issues |

---

## **1️⃣1️⃣ Regularly Reviewing and Cleaning Up Labels**
### **🔹 Why Clean Up Labels?**
- Prevents **duplicate or inconsistent labels** (`bug`, `bugs`, `Bug`).
- Improves **filtering and searchability**.
- Helps maintain **clean project organization**.

### **🔹 Best Practices**
✅ Establish **naming conventions** (`feature-xyz`, `backend-issue`).  
✅ Limit labels to **specific categories** (e.g., `bug`, `infra`).  
✅ Review and **merge duplicates** regularly.

**Example: Merging `critical` and `high-priority` into `priority-high`**.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✅ **Agile & Scrum**: Flexible, iterative development methodology.  
✅ **Waterfall vs Agile**: Waterfall is rigid; Agile is adaptive.  
✅ **Story Pointing & Burndown Charts**: Helps estimate work and track sprint progress.  
✅ **Scrum Ceremonies**: Sprint Planning, Stand-ups, Reviews, and Retrospectives.  
✅ **JIRA**: Tracks tasks, sprints, and issues using labels & queries.
