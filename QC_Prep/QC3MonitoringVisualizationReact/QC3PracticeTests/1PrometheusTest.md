## **Section 4: Code Output Questions**  
_What is the expected result of the following Prometheus metric queries?_

16. **What does the following metric represent?**
   ```promql
   http_requests_total{method="POST"}
   ```
   - a) The number of successful requests  
   - b) The number of POST requests handled by the system  
   - c) The total memory usage of the application  
   - d) The average response time of an API  

17. **Which metric type is best suited for tracking API request durations?**
   ```promql
   http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"}
   ```
   - a) Counter  
   - b) Gauge  
   - c) Histogram  
   - d) Summary  

18. **What will happen when you execute this Prometheus query?**
   ```promql
   sum(rate(cpu_usage[5m]))
   ```
   - a) Returns the current CPU usage  
   - b) Computes the total CPU usage over 5 minutes  
   - c) Displays the error logs from the CPU monitoring system  
   - d) Triggers an alert in Grafana

## **Section 5: Practical Questions**  

19. **Write a PromQL query to count the total number of HTTP requests for a specific instance.**  
   ```promql
   # Your query here
   ```

20. **Modify the following Prometheus YAML configuration to scrape metrics from an additional target (`server2:9100`).**
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: "prometheus"
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
   ```
   âœ… **Modify the YAML to include `server2:9100` as a target.**  

21. **Write a Prometheus command to start Prometheus with a custom configuration file named `custom-config.yml`.**
   ```sh
   # Your command here
   ```

22. **Explain the difference between a `Counter` and a `Gauge` metric in Prometheus, and give an example of when to use each.**
