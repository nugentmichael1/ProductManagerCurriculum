Hereâ€™s a **quick summary** of the SQL topics you listed:

---

### **Aggregate Functions**
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a **single value**.

**Common SQL Aggregate Functions:**
- `COUNT()` â€“ Counts the number of rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users;
  ```
- `SUM()` â€“ Adds up numeric values.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(price) FROM Orders;
  ```
- `AVG()` â€“ Returns the average value.
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- `MIN()` â€“ Finds the smallest value.
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(age) FROM Customers;
  ```
- `MAX()` â€“ Finds the largest value.
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(score) FROM Students;
  ```

---

### **Clauses**
SQL **clauses** filter or modify query results.

**Common SQL Clauses:**
- `WHERE` â€“ Filters records based on a condition.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE age > 18;
  ```
- `HAVING` â€“ Filters results after aggregation.
  ```sql
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
  ```
- `ORDER BY` â€“ Sorts query results.
  ```sql
  SELECT name, age FROM Users ORDER BY age DESC;
  ```
- `GROUP BY` â€“ Groups data for aggregation.
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY department;
  ```
- `LIMIT` â€“ Restricts the number of returned rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

### **What is a Join?**
A **JOIN** combines rows from multiple tables based on a **common column**.

**Example:**  
Combining `Customers` and `Orders` tables based on `customer_id`:
```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_date
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
```
Joins help **eliminate redundant data** by linking tables instead of duplicating information.

---

### **Aliases**
Aliases **rename tables or columns** temporarily within a query.

**Column Alias:**
```sql
SELECT name AS FullName FROM Users;
```
**Table Alias:**
```sql
SELECT u.name, o.total FROM Users u JOIN Orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```
Aliases improve **readability** and simplify long queries.

---

### **Cross Join**
A **Cross Join** produces a **Cartesian product**, pairing **every row** from the first table with **every row** from the second.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT A.name, B.product
FROM Customers A
CROSS JOIN Products B;
```
If `Customers` has 10 rows and `Products` has 5, the result will have **10 Ã— 5 = 50 rows**.

---

### **Equi and Theta Joins**
- **Equi Join** â€“ Uses an **exact match (`=`)** between two columns.
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.name, Departments.department_name
  FROM Employees
  JOIN Departments ON Employees.department_id = Departments.id;
  ```
- **Theta Join** â€“ Uses a **non-equality condition (`<`, `>`, `!=`)**.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees E
  JOIN Salaries S ON E.salary > S.average_salary;
  ```

---

### **Inner Join**
An **Inner Join** returns only **matching records** from both tables.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_date
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
```
If a customer has no orders, they **won't appear** in the result.

---

### **Left and Right Joins**
- **Left Join** â€“ Returns all records from the **left table** and matching records from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_date
  FROM Customers
  LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
  ```
  Customers **without orders** will still be included.

- **Right Join** â€“ Returns all records from the **right table** and matching records from the left table.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_date
  FROM Customers
  RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
  ```
  Orders **without a customer match** will still appear.

---

### **Outer Join**
An **Outer Join** returns **all records from both tables**, inserting `NULL` for missing matches.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_date
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
```
If **no match is found**, one side of the result **will have NULL values**.

---

### **What is a Transaction?**
A **transaction** is a sequence of operations **executed as a single unit** to ensure **data integrity**.

**Example Transaction:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
If any step fails, you can **ROLLBACK** to undo changes.

---

### **Connect SQL**
**CONNECT SQL** typically refers to:
1. Connecting an **application to a SQL database**.
2. Using the `CONNECT` statement (in databases like Oracle) to switch users.

**Example (Connecting via MySQL CLI):**
```sh
mysql -u root -p
```
**Example (Connecting in Python using MySQL):**
```python
import mysql.connector
conn = mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost", user="root", password="password", database="mydb")
```

---

### **ACID Properties**
ACID ensures **reliable database transactions**:

1. **Atomicity** â€“ Transactions are **all or nothing**.  
   ðŸ”¹ *If any part fails, the whole transaction is undone (ROLLBACK).*
   
2. **Consistency** â€“ The database moves **from one valid state to another**.  
   ðŸ”¹ *Ensures constraints (e.g., foreign keys) are enforced.*
   
3. **Isolation** â€“ Concurrent transactions **don't interfere** with each other.  
   ðŸ”¹ *Prevents data corruption in multi-user environments.*
   
4. **Durability** â€“ Once committed, changes **persist permanently**.  
   ðŸ”¹ *Data survives power failures or crashes.*

**Example of ACID Compliance:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
If the database crashes before `COMMIT`, the changes **won't be saved**.
