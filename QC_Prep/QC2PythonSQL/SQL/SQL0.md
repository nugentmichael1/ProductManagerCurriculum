Sure! Here's a **quick summary** of each SQL topic you mentioned:

---

### **What is SQL?**
SQL (**Structured Query Language**) is a language used to interact with **relational databases**. It allows users to **store, retrieve, update, and delete** data using commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

---

### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is an organized collection of **data** stored in a structured way, making it easy to retrieve, manage, and manipulate. **Relational Databases** store data in **tables** with rows and columns.

---

### **Consistency**
**Consistency** ensures that a database remains in a **valid state** after any transaction. A transaction should move the database **from one valid state to another** by enforcing data integrity constraints (like primary keys and foreign keys).

**Example:**  
If a bank transfer transaction is initiated but fails midway, the money should not be deducted from one account without being credited to another.

---

### **Introduction to RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**
An **RDBMS** is a type of database system that stores data in **tables** and maintains relationships between them using **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key, etc.).

Popular RDBMS examples:
- **MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Oracle Database**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**

---

### **Schema**
A **schema** is the **blueprint** of a database. It defines:
- The structure of tables
- Data types of columns
- Relationships between tables

**Example:** A schema might define a `Users` table with columns like `id`, `name`, and `email`.

---

### **Table Structure**
A **table** consists of:
- **Columns** (fields) â€“ Represent attributes (e.g., `name`, `age`).
- **Rows** (records) â€“ Represent individual entries.
  
Example of a `Users` table:

| id  | name  | age |
|-----|-------|-----|
| 1   | John  | 25  |
| 2   | Alice | 30  |

---

### **SQL Data Types**
SQL provides **data types** to define the kind of data a column can store. Common types include:
- **INTEGER** â€“ Whole numbers (`id INT`)
- **VARCHAR(n)** â€“ Variable-length text (`name VARCHAR(50)`)
- **DATE** â€“ Stores dates (`birthday DATE`)
- **BOOLEAN** â€“ True/False values
- **DECIMAL(n, d)** â€“ Fixed precision numbers (`price DECIMAL(10,2)`)

---

### **Normalization**
**Normalization** is the process of **organizing a database** to reduce **redundancy** and improve **data integrity**. It involves dividing a table into smaller related tables.

**Normalization levels (Normal Forms - NF):**
1. **1NF (First Normal Form)** â€“ Ensure atomicity (no repeating groups).
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)** â€“ Ensure all columns depend on the primary key.
3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)** â€“ Remove transitive dependencies (no indirect dependencies).

---

### **Multiplicity**
Multiplicity defines the **relationship cardinality** between entities in a database:
- **One-to-One (1:1)** â€“ One entity is related to exactly one other entity.
- **One-to-Many (1:M)** â€“ One entity is related to multiple others.
- **Many-to-Many (M:M)** â€“ Multiple entities relate to multiple others.

**Example:**
- A **student** (1) enrolls in multiple **courses** (M) â†’ One-to-Many.

---

### **Data Modeling and ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**
**Data Modeling** is the process of designing a database structure before implementation.  
**ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** visually represents **entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships**.

Example ERD:
ðŸ“Œ **Customer** â†’ Places â†’ **Order**  
(Customer **has many** Orders)

---

### **Primary Key**
A **Primary Key (PK)** is a unique identifier for each row in a table.

**Example:**  
- `id` in a `Users` table (`id INT PRIMARY KEY`)

---

### **Composite Key**
A **Composite Key** is a primary key made up of **two or more columns**.

**Example:**  
A `StudentCourses` table may have:
- `student_id`
- `course_id`

Both together act as the **composite primary key**.

---

### **Foreign Key**
A **Foreign Key (FK)** is a column that references a **Primary Key in another table** to maintain relationships.

**Example:**
A `Orders` table with a **foreign key reference** to the `Customers` table:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(id)
```

---

### **Unique Key**
A **Unique Key** ensures that a column contains **unique** values but allows `NULL` values.

**Example:**  
An `email` column in a `Users` table should be unique:

```sql
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
```

---

### **Secondary (Alternate) Key**
A **Secondary Key** is an alternative unique key that is not the **Primary Key**.

**Example:**  
In a `Users` table:
- **Primary Key:** `id`
- **Alternate Key:** `email` (since it must be unique)

---

### **Referential Integrity**
**Referential Integrity** ensures that **foreign key references remain valid**.

**Example:**
- If a row in `Customers` is deleted, all its **related orders** in `Orders` should either be deleted (`CASCADE`) or prevented (`RESTRICT`).

```sql
ON DELETE CASCADE
```
