a) PRIMARY KEY  
b) FOREIGN KEY  
c) UNIQUE  
d) CHECK  

**5. In a relational database, what is the purpose of a foreign key?**  
a) To uniquely identify each row in a table

### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**
**9.** The ________ operator is used to enforce referential integrity between two tables by ensuring that values in the foreign key column match values in the referenced tableâ€™s primary key column.  

**10.** A ________ is a visual representation of database entities and their relationships, commonly used in data modeling.  

**11.** In a relational database, a table is made up of ________ (rows) and ________ (columns).  

**12.** The process of structuring a database to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller ones is called ________.  

**13.** The ________ constraint automatically assigns a unique numeric value to a column for each new record inserted into the table.

### **Section 3: True or False**
**14.** A schema defines the structure of a database, including tables, columns, and constraints. (**True/False**)  

**15.** A composite key consists of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify a record. (**True/False**)  

**16.** The PRIMARY KEY constraint allows multiple NULL values in the column. (**True/False**)  

**17.** In a many-to-many relationship, an intermediate table is often required to manage the relationship between two entities. (**True/False**)  

**18.** The UNIQUE key constraint is the same as a primary key but allows NULL values. (**True/False**)

### **Section 5: Coding Questions**
**24.** Write an SQL statement to create a `Customers` table with the following columns:
- `id` (Primary Key, auto-incrementing)
- `name` (VARCHAR 50, cannot be NULL)
- `email` (VARCHAR 100, unique)
- `created_at` (DATE, defaults to current date)  

**25.** Write an SQL statement to create a `Orders` table with:
- `order_id` as the Primary Key
- `customer_id` as a Foreign Key referencing `Customers(id)`
- `order_date` as a DATE column  

**26.** Write an SQL query to retrieve all customers whose name starts with 'A'.  

**27.** Write an SQL query to find all orders placed by a specific customer with `customer_id = 5`.  

**28.** Write an SQL query to count how many orders each customer has placed, sorted in descending order.

### **Bonus Question**
**29.** A **secondary key** (or alternate key) is another unique identifier for a record besides the primary key. Give an example of when a secondary key might be useful in a real-world application.
