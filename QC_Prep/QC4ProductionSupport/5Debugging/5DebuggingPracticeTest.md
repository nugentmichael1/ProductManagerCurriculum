# **Debugging Lifecycle Practice Test**

## **Section 1: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)**  
*(Select the best answer for each question.)*

**1. What is the primary goal of the debugging lifecycle?**  
   a) To deploy software faster  
   b) To systematically identify, analyze, and resolve software issues  
   c) To eliminate all possible bugs before writing code  
   d) To add more features while fixing bugs  

**2. Which of the following is NOT a common method of bug detection?**  
   a) User reports  
   b) Automated testing  
   c) Running the code without monitoring  
   d) Crash reports  

**3. What is the purpose of monitoring systems in software applications?**  
   a) To slow down application execution for debugging  
   b) To provide real-time alerts and track system performance  
   c) To randomly generate bugs for testing purposes  
   d) To store all historical software issues forever  

**4. What is the first step in reproducing a bug?**  
   a) Immediately fixing the issue  
   b) Gathering relevant information about the bug  
   c) Modifying random code to see what happens  
   d) Deploying a patch before understanding the root cause  

**5. Which of the following tools is commonly used for debugging in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?**  
   a) SonarQube  
   b) Visual Studio Debugger  
   c) Postman  
   d) JMeter  

**6. What role does logging play in debugging?**  
   a) It helps track runtime errors and application behavior  
   b) It automatically fixes bugs before they occur  
   c) It replaces the need for version control  
   d) It prevents new features from being added  

**7. What is the purpose of using version control systems like Git during bug resolution?**  
   a) To make sure only one developer can access the code at a time  
   b) To track code changes, manage fixes, and roll back if needed  
   c) To replace the need for automated testing  
   d) To delete old bugs permanently  

**8. What type of testing ensures that fixing a bug has not introduced new issues in the software?**  
   a) Performance testing  
   b) Regression testing  
   c) Load testing  
   d) Unit testing  

**9. Which of the following deployment strategies involves releasing updates to only a small portion of users before a full rollout?**  
   a) Blue-green deployment  
   b) Canary release  
   c) Rolling deployment  
   d) Immediate full deployment  

**10. After deployment, which method is used to verify that the bug fix works correctly in a live environment?**  
   a) Ignoring the software for a week  
   b) Automated health checks, monitoring, and user feedback  
   c) Deleting all logs and restarting the application  
   d) Waiting for new bug reports from users

## **Section 2: True/False Questions**  
*(Write "True" or "False" for each statement.)*

**11.** The debugging lifecycle is a linear process that does not require revisiting previous steps.  

**12.** Error tracking tools like Sentry and Firebase Crashlytics help capture runtime issues in production environments.  

**13.** Monitoring systems are only useful during deployment and can be turned off afterward.  

**14.** The ability to consistently reproduce a bug is crucial for diagnosing and fixing it effectively.  

**15.** Performance testing is a type of testing that focuses on verifying individual functions of the software.  

**16.** Version control systems like Git allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a fix causes new issues.  

**17.** A rollback plan is necessary in case a bug fix creates more problems than it solves.  

**18.** Canary releases allow for gradual deployment, which minimizes the risk of system-wide failures.  

**19.** The purpose of documentation and logging is only to help users understand the software, not for developers to track issues.  

**20.** The final step in debugging is monitoring the system after deployment to ensure stability.

## **Section 3: Short-Answer Questions**  
*(Provide brief answers to the following questions.)*

**21.** What are three common methods used to detect software bugs?  

**22.** Why is reproducing a bug an important step in the debugging process?  

**23.** Name two common monitoring tools used to track software performance.  

**24.** How does logging help developers diagnose software issues?  

**25.** What are three types of testing used to ensure that a bug fix does not introduce new issues?  

**26.** What is the purpose of version control systems in debugging?  

**27.** Explain why clear communication is important when escalating a bug.  

**28.** What is the difference between blue-green deployment and canary releases?  

**29.** How does post-deployment monitoring help prevent future software failures?  

**30.** Why is it important to document resolved bugs and their fixes in an IT system?
