b) Updating multiple records in a table.  
c) Creating foreign key relationships.  
d) Applying referential integrity constraints.  

**8. The **CASCADE** option in foreign keys ensures that:**

### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**  
**9.** The SQL sublanguage used to grant and revoke permissions on a database is called ________.  

**10.** ________ ensures that a column automatically assigns a value if none is provided.  

**11.** The ________ clause in SQL is used to filter records retrieved in a `SELECT` query.  

**12.** The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records in a table, and it is part of the ________ SQL sublanguage.  

**13.** The **INSERT** statement is used to ________ new records into a table.  

**14.** The `CHECK` constraint is used to ensure that values in a column meet a specified ________.  

**15.** The **CASCADE** option in foreign keys helps maintain ________ integrity when deleting or updating related records.

### **Section 3: True or False**  
**16.** DCL (Data Control Language) includes commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to manage user privileges. (**True/False**)  

**17.** The `TRUNCATE` statement removes only a specific set of records based on conditions in the `WHERE` clause. (**True/False**)  

**18.** The `DEFAULT` constraint ensures that if no value is provided for a column, a predefined value is assigned. (**True/False**)  

**19.** A table can have multiple columns with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute. (**True/False**)  

**20.** The `CASCADE` option allows updates or deletions in a parent table to automatically affect child tables. (**True/False**)

### **Section 4: Short Answer Questions**  
**21.** What is the purpose of the **DDL** sublanguage in SQL?  

**22.** Define **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** and provide an example of how it is used.  

**23.** Explain the difference between the **CREATE**, **DROP**, and **TRUNCATE** statements.  

**24.** What is the function of the **CHECK** constraint in SQL? Give an example.

### **Section 5: SQL Coding Questions**  
**26.** Write an SQL statement to create a `Products` table with the following columns:  
- `product_id` (Primary Key, auto-incrementing)  
- `name` (VARCHAR 100, cannot be NULL)  
- `price` (DECIMAL, must be greater than 0 using CHECK constraint)  
- `stock` (INTEGER, defaults to 0)  

**27.** Write an SQL query to insert a new product into the `Products` table with:  
- `name = 'Laptop'`  
- `price = 1200.50`  

**28.** Write an SQL query to update the `price` of a product to `999.99` where the `product_id` is `5`.  

**29.** Write an SQL query to delete all products that have `stock = 0`.  

**30.** Write an SQL query to retrieve all products that cost more than `$500`, sorted by price in descending order.
