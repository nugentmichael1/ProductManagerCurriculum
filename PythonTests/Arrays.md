### **Python Arrays Test**

#### **Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**  
**1.** What is an array in Python?  
   a) A list that stores different data types  
   b) An ordered collection of elements that can have different data types  
   c) An object that stores a group of elements of the same data type  
   d) A dictionary that maps keys to values  

**2.** Which module needs to be imported to work with arrays in Python?  
   a) `math`  
   b) `numpy`  
   c) `array`  
   d) `random`  

**3.** What is the correct way to create an array of floating-point numbers?  
   a) `arr = array('i', [1.5, 2.3, 3.6])`  
   b) `arr = array('f', [1.5, 2.3, 3.6])`  
   c) `arr = array('d', [1, 2, 3])`  
   d) `arr = array('c', ['a', 'b', 'c'])`  

**4.** What does the following code output?  
   ```python
   from array import *
   arr = array('i', [5, 10, 15, 20])
   print(arr[2])
   ```  
   a) 5  
   b) 10  
   c) 15  
   d) 20  

**5.** Which of the following is used to create an empty array?

#### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**  
**6.** The type code used to create a **double precision floating-point array** is `__________`.  

**7.** To remove the last element of an array, we use the method `__________()`.  

**8.** The function `arange(10, 20, 2)` in NumPy generates an array starting from **__________** to **__________** with a step size of **__________**.  

**9.** The function `__________()` in NumPy is used to create an array with evenly spaced elements between two values.  

**10.** To find the **maximum value** in a NumPy array `arr`, we use `arr.__________()`.

#### **Section 3: True or False**  
**11.** The `array` module in Python allows storing elements of different data types in the same array. (True/False)  

**12.** The `insert()` method in an array allows adding an element at a specific position. (True/False)  

**13.** The `pop(x)` method removes the element at index `x` from an array. (True/False)  

**14.** NumPy arrays can store multiple data types in the same array. (True/False)  

**15.** The `zeros()` function in NumPy creates an array where all elements are initialized to zero. (True/False)

#### **Section 4: Coding Questions**  

**16.** Write a Python program to create an **integer type array** containing the values `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}` and print it.  
```python
# Your code here
```

**17.** Write a Python program to create an array from another array by multiplying each element by **2**.  
```python
# Your code here

**20.** Write a Python program that generates an array with values from **1 to 10** using `arange()`.  
```python
# Your code here
```
