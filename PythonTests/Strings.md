#### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**  

**6.** A string in Python can be enclosed in `_________`, `_________`, or `_________` quotes.  

**7.** The `_________` operator is used to concatenate two strings in Python.  

**8.** The method `_________` returns the total number of characters in a string.  

**9.** The `_________` method converts all characters in a string to uppercase.  

**10.** The method `_________` returns a list of words in the string, separated by whitespace or a given delimiter.

#### **Section 3: True or False**  

**11.** In Python, strings are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation. (True/False)  

**12.** The `find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, or `-1` if not found. (True/False)  

**13.** The `startswith()` method checks if a string starts with a specific substring. (True/False)  

**14.** The `replace()` method permanently modifies the original string. (True/False)  

**15.** The `sorted()` function can be used to sort a string alphabetically. (True/False)
