#### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**  

**6.** Python is an `__________` programming language, meaning it executes code line by line rather than compiling it first.  

**7.** Python follows `__________` indentation, meaning the number of spaces used in indentation must be consistent.  

**8.** A `__________` is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`), double (`"`) or triple (`'''`) quotes.  

**9.** The Python interpreter ignores anything that follows the `__________` symbol in a line of code.  

**10.** The `__________` module is used to handle command-line arguments in Python programs.

#### **Section 3: True or False**  

**11.** Python supports both single and multi-line comments. (True/False)  

**12.** Python uses curly braces `{}` for defining blocks of code. (True/False)  

**13.** Python is an open-source programming language. (True/False)  

**14.** Python is statically typed, meaning variables must be declared with a type before use. (True/False)  

**15.** The `sys` module allows handling of command-line arguments in Python. (True/False)
