The **PromQL query**:
```promql
rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[1m])
```
is used in **Prometheus** to measure the rate of incoming network traffic on a node over a **1-minute window**.

---

## **Breaking Down the Syntax**
### **1️⃣ `node_network_receive_bytes_total`**
- This is a **metric** collected by **Node Exporter**.
- It represents the **total number of bytes received** on all network interfaces since the system started.
- This is a **counter metric**, meaning it only increases over time (except for resets).

### **2️⃣ `[1m]` (Range Vector)**
- **Specifies a time window** of **1 minute** (`1m`).
- Tells Prometheus to look at the last **1 minute** of samples for this metric.
- **Only works with range functions** like `rate()`, `increase()`, `avg_over_time()`, etc.

### **3️⃣ `rate()` (Instant Vector Function)**
- `rate()` calculates the **per-second rate of change** for a **counter metric** over the given time range.
- Converts a **monotonic counter** into a **rate of change per second**.
- **Formula**:
  ```
  rate(counter_metric[range]) = (last_value - first_value) / time_elapsed
  ```
- Helps smooth out variations in the data by looking at the trend over time.

---

## **🔹 What Does This Query Do?**
- **Finds how fast bytes are being received per second** over a **1-minute window**.
- If the metric **increased by 300 bytes** over **1 minute**, `rate()` would return:
  ```
  300 bytes / 60 seconds = 5 bytes per second
  ```
- Returns an **instant vector**, which means the query is evaluated at a **single point in time**.

---

## **✅ Practical Example**
If you want to monitor **network traffic trends**, you can use:
```promql
rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m])
```
🔹 This shows the **bytes received per second**, averaged over the last **5 minutes**.

For **interface-specific network traffic**, add a **label filter**:
```promql
rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total{device="eth0"}[1m])
```
🔹 This monitors traffic **only on `eth0`**.

---

## **🔍 When to Use `rate()` vs. `increase()`**
| Function  | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|
| `rate()`  | **Per-second rate of change** (smooths data over time). Best for dashboards & real-time monitoring. |
| `increase()` | **Total increase over a given period**. Best for cumulative reports. |

Example:
```promql
increase(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m])
```
🔹 **Shows how many bytes were received in the last 5 minutes** instead of bytes per second.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
- **`node_network_receive_bytes_total`** → Total bytes received.
- **`rate()`** → Computes **bytes received per second**.
- **`[1m]`** → Averages the rate over **1-minute window**.
- **Used for monitoring real-time network traffic trends**.
