## **Test: Python Lists and Tuples**
**Total Marks:** 20  
**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

### **Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)** (2 marks each)

**1. What is the index of the first element in a Python list?**  
   a) 0  
   b) 1  
   c) -1  
   d) None of the above  

**2. What will be the output of the following code?**  
```python
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(list1[1:4])
```
   a) `[10, 20, 30]`  
   b) `[20, 30, 40]`  
   c) `[30, 40, 50]`  
   d) `[10, 20, 30, 40]`  

**3. Which of the following methods is used to add an element to a list?**  
   a) `add()`  
   b) `insert()`  
   c) `append()`  
   d) `extend()`

**4. What will be the result of the following code?**  
```python
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(list1 + list2)
```
   a) `['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]`  
   b) `[['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]`  
   c) `TypeError`  
   d) `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']`

**5. Which of the following statements about tuples is TRUE?**  
   a) Tuples are mutable  
   b) Tuples can contain elements of different data types  
   c) Tuples use square brackets `[]`  
   d) Tuples cannot be concatenated

### **Section 2: True/False Questions** (1 mark each)

**6.** The `remove()` method deletes an item from a list based on its index. **(True/False)**  

**7.** In Python, negative indices start from `-1` for the last element of a sequence. **(True/False)**  

**8.** The `max()` function can be used on both lists and tuples. **(True/False)**  

**9.** Lists and tuples support concatenation using the `+` operator. **(True/False)**  

**10.** The `pop()` method in a list always removes the last element, and it cannot remove elements at specific indices. **(True/False)**

### **Section 3: Fill in the Blanks** (1 mark each)

**11.** The `______()` function returns the number of elements in a list or tuple.  

**12.** The `______()` method is used to sort a list in place, while the `______()` function returns a new sorted list.  

**13.** A tuple is created using **parentheses** `()` while a list is created using **______**.  

**14.** The `______()` method reverses the order of elements in a list in place.  

**15.** The `list()` method can be used to convert a **tuple** into a **______**.

---

### **Section 4: Short Answer Questions** (2 marks each)

**16.** Write a Python program to create a list of numbers from 5 to 15 using the `range()` function and print each element using a loop.  

**17.** What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` methods in a list? Provide an example of each.  

**18.** Given the following list:  
```python
list1 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
How would you:
  - Remove `'banana'` from the list?
  - Insert `'grape'` at index `1`?

**19.** What will be the output of the following code? Explain why.
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple1[1] = 5
print(tuple1)
```

**20.** Given two lists:
```python
list1 = [10, 20, 30]
list2 = [20, 30, 40]
```
Write a Python program to find the common elements between `list1` and `list2` using **set operations**.
