### **Test: Inheritance and Polymorphism in Python**  
**Total Marks:** 20  
**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to the best of your ability.  

#### **Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)** (2 marks each)

**1. What is the primary purpose of inheritance in Python?**  
   a) To create multiple instances of a class  
   b) To define new classes based on existing ones  
   c) To create private attributes in a class  
   d) To execute a function repeatedly  

**2. What will the following code output?**  
```python
class A:
    def method(self):
        print("A method")

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.method()
```
   a) Error: `method()` is not defined in `B`  
   b) `A method`  
   c) No output  
   d) `B method`  

**3. What does the `super()` function do in Python?**  
   a) Calls the subclass constructor  
   b) Calls the superclass constructor or method  
   c) Returns the subclass object  
   d) Creates a new instance of the class  

**4. How does Python resolve method calls in multiple inheritance?**  
   a) Right-to-left order  
   b) Bottom-to-top order  
   c) Method Resolution Order (MRO)  
   d) Randomly  

**5. Which of the following statements about method overriding is **false**?**  
   a) The subclass method must have the same name as the superclass method  
   b) The subclass method replaces the superclass method  
   c) Method overriding only works with the `super()` function  
   d) The subclass method can have different behavior than the superclass method

#### **Section 2: True/False Questions** (1 mark each)

**6.** The `issubclass()` function checks whether an instance belongs to a class. **(True/False)**  

**7.** The `isinstance()` function returns `True` if an object is an instance of a given class or a subclass. **(True/False)**  

**8.** If a subclass defines a constructor, the superclass constructor is automatically called. **(True/False)**  

**9.** In multiple inheritance, Python searches for methods in the order defined by the class hierarchy, known as MRO. **(True/False)**  

**10.** Method overloading is fully supported in Python, allowing multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. **(True/False)**  

---

#### **Section 3: Short Answer Questions** (2 marks each)

**11.** Write a Python class `Animal` with a method `speak()` that prints `"This animal makes a sound."` and a subclass `Dog` that overrides `speak()` to print `"The dog barks."`  

**12.** What is the difference between **method overloading** and **method overriding** in Python?  

**13.** Explain why calling `super().__init__()` is necessary in a subclass constructor when inheriting from a superclass.  

**14.** What is operator overloading? Give an example of overloading the `+` operator in a custom class.  

**15.** Given the following class structure, determine the output when an instance of `C` is created:  
```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("A constructor")

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        print("B constructor")
        super().__init__()

class C(B):
    def __init__(self):
        print("C constructor")
        super().__init__()

c = C()
```

### **Advanced Challenges & Coding Problems on Inheritance & Polymorphism** ðŸš€  

Here are **three challenging problems** to test your deep understanding of **inheritance, polymorphism, method resolution order (MRO), operator overloading, and method overriding.**  

---

## **Problem 1: Complex Multiple Inheritance (MRO Challenge)**
### **Description:**
Consider the following class hierarchy:  
- **A** has a method `show()`  
- **B** and **C** inherit from **A**  
- **D** inherits from **B** and **C**  

1. Define these classes in Python.
2. Override `show()` in `B` and `C` (but not in `D`).
3. Create an instance of `D` and call `show()`.
4. Print the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** using `D.mro()` and explain the output.

### **Expected Output Pattern**
- The `show()` method should follow **Python's MRO rules** (depth-first, left-to-right).
- Printing `D.mro()` should clarify the execution order.

---

## **Problem 2: Operator Overloading for a Custom Vector Class**
### **Description:**
Define a class `Vector` to represent **2D vectors** with `x` and `y` components. Implement **operator overloading** for:
- `+` to add two vectors.
- `-` to subtract two vectors.
- `==` to compare if two vectors are equal.
- `*` (scalar multiplication) to multiply a vector by a number.

### **Example Usage:**
```python
v1 = Vector(3, 4)
v2 = Vector(1, 2)
v3 = v1 + v2  # (4,6)
v4 = v1 - v2  # (2,2)
v5 = v1 * 2   # (6,8)
print(v1 == v2)  # False
print(v3)  # Should print Vector(4,6)
```

### **Expected Output**
```python
Vector(4,6)
Vector(2,2)
Vector(6,8)
False
```

## **Problem 3: Method Overriding with `super()` in an RPG Game**
### **Description:**
You need to create a **simple RPG class hierarchy**:
- `Character`: A base class with attributes `name` and `health`. It has a method `take_damage(amount)` that reduces health.
- `Warrior`: Inherits from `Character` and overrides `take_damage()`. If the damage is more than 20, it **blocks** half of it.
- `Mage`: Inherits from `Character` and overrides `take_damage()`. Mages **ignore** damage less than 5.

### **Example Usage:**
```python
w = Warrior("Thor", 100)
m = Mage("Gandalf", 100)

w.take_damage(30)  # Thor should only take 15 damage
m.take_damage(4)   # Gandalf should take no damage
m.take_damage(10)  # Gandalf should take 10 damage

print(w.health)  # 85
print(m.health)  # 90
```

---

### **Bonus Problem: Custom `__call__` Method in a Class**
#### **Description:**
Define a class `Counter` where an instance behaves like a function when called.
- Every time an instance is called, it should increment an internal counter and return its value.
  
#### **Example Usage:**
```python
c = Counter()
print(c())  # 1
print(c())  # 2
print(c())  # 3
```
