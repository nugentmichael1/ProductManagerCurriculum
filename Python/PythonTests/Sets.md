### **Python Sets Test**

#### **Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**  
**1.** What is a key characteristic of a Python set?  
   a) It allows duplicate elements  
   b) It maintains the insertion order  
   c) It is an unordered collection of unique elements  
   d) It allows indexing of elements  

**2.** How do you create an empty set in Python?  
   a) `empty_set = {}`  
   b) `empty_set = []`  
   c) `empty_set = set()`  
   d) `empty_set = dict()`  

**3.** What is the output of the following code?  
   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
   print(my_set)
   ```  
   a) `{1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}`  
   b) `{1, 2, 3, 4}`  
   c) `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  
   d) `Error`  

**4.** Which method is used to add multiple elements to a set?  
   a) `append()`  
   b) `update()`  
   c) `insert()`  
   d) `add()`  

**5.** What will happen if you try to remove an element that does not exist in the set using `discard()`?  
   a) It raises a KeyError  
   b) It removes a random element instead  
   c) It does nothing  
   d) It clears the entire set

#### **Section 2: Fill in the Blanks**  
**6.** A set is an unordered collection of _______________ elements.  

**7.** The method used to remove all elements from a set is `______________`.  

**8.** The `______________` method removes an element from a set, but does not raise an error if the element is missing.  

**9.** The difference between two sets A and B (A - B) returns elements that are only in _______________ but not in _______________.  

**10.** The intersection of two sets can be performed using the `______________` operator or the `______________()` method.

#### **Section 3: True or False**  
**11.** A set can contain a list as an element. (True/False)  

**12.** The `pop()` method removes and returns a random element from the set. (True/False)  

**13.** The `clear()` method removes only duplicate elements from a set. (True/False)  

**14.** The union of two sets A and B contains elements present in either A or B or both. (True/False)  

**15.** The remove() method raises an error if the element is not found in the set. (True/False)

#### **Section 4: Coding Questions**  

**16.** Write a Python program to create a set containing the values `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}` and print it.  
```python
# Your code here
```

**17.** Write a Python program to add the element **60** to the set `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`.  
```python
# Your code here
```

**18.** Write a Python program to find the union of the sets `A = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `B = {3, 4, 5, 6}` using both the `|` operator and the `union()` method.  
```python
# Your code here
```

**19.** Write a Python program to remove the element **5** from the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` using both `discard()` and `remove()`.  
```python
# Your code here
```

**20.** Write a Python program to check if the set `B = {3, 4, 5, 6}` is a subset of `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.  
```python
# Your code here
```
