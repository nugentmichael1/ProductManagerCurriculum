No, you **cannot** use the `apt` module to update all slave nodes if they use different package managers like **dnf** or **yum**. Ansible is **platform-agnostic**, but the modules you use **must match the package manager** available on each system.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Why Won't `apt` Work on `dnf/yum` Systems?**
- `apt` is **only for Debian-based systems** (Ubuntu, Debian).
- `dnf` and `yum` are **used in RHEL-based systems** (Amazon Linux, CentOS, Fedora).
- If you run:
  ```sh
  ansible all -m apt -a "update_cache=yes" -b
  ```
  on a **Red Hat-based system**, it will **fail** because `apt` does not exist there.

---

## **âœ… Solution: Use the Correct Package Manager for Each OS**
Ansible provides:
- `apt` â†’ for **Debian/Ubuntu**
- `dnf` â†’ for **Amazon Linux 2023, RHEL 8+, Fedora**
- `yum` â†’ for **Amazon Linux 2, RHEL 7, CentOS 7**

### **ðŸ”¹ Example Playbook Handling Different OS Types**
To update all machines **correctly**, use **`ansible_facts`** to detect the OS and choose the right package manager:

```yaml
- name: Update all systems
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update Debian-based systems
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"

    - name: Update RHEL-based systems (Amazon Linux, RHEL, CentOS)
      dnf:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"

    - name: Update older RHEL-based systems (using yum)
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat" and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version']|int < 8
```

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Running as an Ad-Hoc Command**
If you just need to update **all servers dynamically**, use:
```sh
ansible all -m package -a "name=* state=latest" -b
```
âœ… The **`package`** module is **cross-platform** and automatically selects:
- `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu
- `dnf` or `yum` for RHEL-based distros

---

## **ðŸš€ Summary**
| **Module**  | **Works On** | **Command / Playbook Example** |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `apt`      | Ubuntu, Debian | `ansible all -m apt -a "update_cache=yes" -b` |
| `dnf`      | Amazon Linux 2023, RHEL 8+, Fedora | `ansible all -m dnf -a "name=* state=latest" -b` |
| `yum`      | Amazon Linux 2, RHEL 7, CentOS 7 | `ansible all -m yum -a "name=* state=latest" -b` |
| `package`  | **Any OS** (auto-detects) | `ansible all -m package -a "name=* state=latest" -b` âœ… Best choice for mixed environments |
