AWS : AMAZON WEB SERVICES 

IT IS A SUITE OF CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES OFFERED BY AMAZON.

CLOUD COMPUTING : ON DEMAND DELIVERY OF SERVICES.

CLOUD HAS BEEN CATEGORISED INTO 3 TYPES

1) PUBLIC CLOUD : SERVICES OF THIS CLOUD ARE AVAILABLE TO BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATION VIA THE INTERNET.
EX : AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI, SALESFORCE, DIGITAL OCEAN

2) PRIVATE CLOUD : SERVICES OF THIS CLOUD ARE AVAILABLE TO AUTHORISED EMPLOYEES OF THE ORGANISATION ONLY.
EX : OPENSTACK

3) HYBRID CLOUD : COMBINATION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUDS IS CALLED HYBRID CLOUD.

FOR CREATING A AWS ACCOUNT YOU CAN USE YOUR DEBIT CARDS WHERE THEY WILL CHARGE YOU A LITTLE AMOUNT WHICH WILL BE REFUNDED BACK TO YOUR ACCOUNTS IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS.

IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR APPLICATION HIGHLY AVAILABLE WE NEED TO PLACE OUR APPLICATION ON TOP OF THE CLOUD.

TASK : EXPLORE AND LET ME KNOW WHAT ARE HIGHLY AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS AND WHICH CLOUD PLATFORMS THEY ARE USING. : 15 MINS 

AWS : 200 SERVICES
AZURE : 300 SERVICES
GCP : 400 SERVICES 

SERVICES IN THE CLOUD HAS BEEN CATEGORISED INTO 3 TYPES

1) IAAS : INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE : EX : VIRTUAL MACHINE, NETWORKS

2) PAAS : PLATFORM AS A SERVICE : EX : DATABASES

3) SAAS : SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE : EX : GMAIL, OUTLOOK

BACKEMD ARCHITECTURE OF CLOUD : CLOUD AT THE BACKEND USES DATACENTER ARCHITECTURE.

DATACENTER : IT IS A PLACE WHERE GROUP OF SERVERS RELATED TO A SPECIFIC ORGANISATION WAS HOSTED.

CLOUD HAS TAKEN A GROGRAPHICAL LOCATION IN EACH AND EVERY CONTINENT AND PLACED MULTIPLE DATA CENTERS FOR FAULT TOLERANCE AND DISASTER RECOVERY.


REGION : A GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION WHERE GROUP OF DATACENTERS WERE HOSTED .

AVAILABILITY ZONE : IT IS A PHYSICALLY ISOLATED DATACENTER INSIDE OF A REGION.

FOR FAULT TOLERANCE EACH AND EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF TWO OR MORE THAN TWO AVAILABILITY ZONES.

COST : CLOUD USES THE CONCEPT OF VIRTUALISATION FOR DELIVERING THE SERVICES

VIRTUALISATION CAN BE ESTABLISHED WITH THE HELP OF A TOOL CALLED HYPERVISOR.

TYPE 1 OR BARE METAL HYPERVISOR : THIS HYPERVISOR DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY KIND OF SOFTWARE AND IT CAN BE INSTALLED ON TOP OF HARDWARE DIRECTLY.
EX : AWS : NITRO ENCLAVES
AZURE : WINDOWS HYPER-V
GCP : KVM HYPERVISOR

TYPE 2 OR SOFTWARE HYPERVISOR : THIS HYPERVISOR REQUIRE OS TO GET INSTALLED.
EX : ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX, VMWARE WORKSTATION.

EC2 : ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE : VIRTUAL MACHINES IN THE CLOUD

OS : IMAGE IN CLOUD : AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE (AMI)
IMAGE : IT IS A TEMPLATE OF OPERATING SYSTEM.
os : WINDOWS, LINUX, MAC
WINDOWS , MAC : LISCENSED OS
LINUX : OPEN SOURCE : SOURCE CODE OF OPERATING SYSTEM IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

UBUNTU : LINUX OS SC + FUNCTIONALITIES + APT ===> UBUNTU LINUX : IMAGE
REDHAT : LINUX OS SX + FUNCTIONALITIES + YUM ===> REDHAT LINUX : IMAGE
AMAZON : LINUX OS SC + FUNCTIONALITIES + YUM ===> AMAZON LINUX : IMAGE

PUBLIC KEY  : USERNAME : AWS CLOUD CONSISTS OF PUBLIC KEY
PRIVATE KEY : PASSWORD : PRIVATE KEY IS GOING TO GET DOWNLOADED IN OUR LOCAL MACHINE.
1) PEM : PRIVACY ENHANCED MAIL : LINUX AND WINDOWS
2) PPK : PUTTY PRIVATE KEY : LINUX

linux : ssh : 22
windows : rdp : 3389


ANSIBLE : 

ENVIRONMENT : BANKING APPLICATION : 100 SERVERS(EC2 INSTANCES) 

INSTALL OR UPDATE THE LIBRARIES OR INSTALL SOME PACKAGES

CONFIGURATION : INSTALLING NECESSARY TOOLS AND SOFTWARES WHICH SUPPORTS THE APPLICATION TO RUN IN REAL TIME

ANSIBLE IS A CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL 

CONFIGURATION SERVER =====> INSTALLING OR UPDATING THE PACKAGES IN ALL THE REMAINING SERVERS.

ANSIBLE IS A TOOL WHICH USED FOR CONFIGURATION AND DESIRED STATE MANAGEMENT.
CHEF, PUPPET, NAGIOS AND SALT

WINDOWS : SCCM

NORMALLY ANSIBLE A AGENTLESS SOFTWARE BUT ATHE BACKEND IT USES PYTHON AND SSH.

172.31.10.111   controller
172.31.3.35     slave1
172.31.1.106    slave2


UBUNTU 24.04 LTS : SSHD IS NOT THERE
UBUNTU 22.04 LTS : SSHD SERVICE IS THERE BUT WE NEED TO MODIFY THE AUTHENTICATION OF PASSWORD 


sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible

SUMMARY :

1 CONTROLLER AND 2 SLAVES 

IN CONTROLLER AND SLAVES WE HAVE EDITED THE /ETC/HOSTS FILES TO REMEMBER THE MACHINES WITH THE NAMES RATHER THAN IP ADDRESSES.

2) WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CONTROLLER CAN BE ABLE TO LOGIN TO SLAVES AND EXECUTE COMMANDS ON BEHALF OF US FOR THAT WE HAVE EDITED THE SSHD CONFIG FILE AND RESTARTED THE SERVICE WITH PASSWORDAUTHENTICATION SET TO YES

3) EVENTHOUGH WE HAVE SET PA TO YES STILL ANSIBLE DOESNOT KNOW THE PASSWORD OF TWO MACHINES FOR THAT WE HAVE CREATED A KEY PAIR CONSISTING OF PUBLIC KEY AND PRIVATE KEY IN CONTROLLER AND WE HAVE COPIED THE PUBLIC KEY TO SLAVES 1 AND SLAVE 2 WHY BECAUSE WHILE ANSIBLE TRIES TO LOGIN TO THE SLAVE MACHINES IT WILL TELL THEM THAT IT HAS PASSWORD(PRIVATE KEY) AND SLAVES WILL CHECK THE PRIVATE KEY WITH COPIED PUBLIC KEY FROM ANSIBLE CONTROLLER AND THEY WILL ALLOW CONTROLLER TO LOGIN TO THEM AND EXECUTE COMMANDS

4) AND WE HAVE INSTALLED ANSIBLE IN CONTROLLER AND WE HAVE INSTRUCTED ANSIBLE TO PING SLAVES AND IT HAS SUCCEEDED IN DOING THE TASK.


IN AWS PART THE SERVERS GOT UPDATED IN THE MORNING SO AGAIN IT PROMPTED ME ERROR SO FOR THAT WE HAVE JUST DISABLED HOSTKEY CHECKING SO THAT ANSIBLE CAN LOGIN TO EVERY SERVER AND EXECUTE THE COMMANDS

TO CREATE A FILE USING ANSIBLE 
ansible -i ansiblevms -a "touch location and name of ile"

PLAYBOOK : ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK IS A FILE CONTAINING ANSIBLE MODULES IN YAML FORMAT WITH ARGUMENTS.

PERFORMED ANSIBLE ADHOC COMMANDS TO INSTALL DELETE AND UPDATE THE PACKAGES USING MODULES LIKE APT USER SETUP FILE ETC/HOSTS
ALL THE CONFIGURATIONS CANNOT BE PERFORMED WITH ADHOC COMMANDS SO THATS WHY WE HAVE USED OPTION OF PLAYBOOK WRITTEN IN YAML FORMAT.

NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DEBUGGING AS I WANTEDLY PERFORMED SOME MISTAKES TO SHOW YOU THAT ALL THE ADHOC COMMANDS CANNOT GIVE YOU DESIRED RESULTS AS SOME WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE HELP OF PLAYBOOKS ONLY.
